# SleepPulse
SleepPulse monitors sleep for individuals with respiratory conditions, tracking oxygen levels and heart rate using Flutter, Firebase, and Python for AI sleep quality prediction.

# About 
SleepPulse provides real-time health monitoring by tracking users' oxygen levels and heart rate during sleep. When oxygen levels fall below a safe threshold, alerts are sent to caregivers, ensuring immediate action. The AI algorithm analyzes sleep patterns to provide insights into sleep quality and potential health risks.
